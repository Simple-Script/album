Functions in the mix, we call 'em on cue,  
Loops in the game, do what we gotta do,  
If-else conditions, check it on the fly,  
While the logic runs, watch that program fly

**(Verse 2)**  
`int main()`, where it all begins,  
Return 0 at the end, that’s how we get in,  
`printf` style, watch the output spin,  
Memory’s breaks, letting leaks from within!

`malloc` to allocate, stack is the key,  
`free()` up the memory, so we stay memory-free,  
Arrays in the mix, zero-index starts,  
Strings on deck, we keep ‘em close to the heart.

**(Chorus)**  
C, C, that's the code I trust,  
From header files down to the pointer’s thrust,  
We’re breakin’ down code, no need for the fuss,  
C script flexin', come along, join us.

---

**(Bridge)**  
From structs to enums, we define the space,  
Preprocessor macros set the pace,  
File I/O, read and write with grace,  
Syntax tight, we don’t leave a trace.

---

**(Outro)**  
So when you need code that's sharp and neat,  
C is the language, can’t be beat,  
From low-level magic to high-speed feats,  
C’s got your back, so take a seat!

---

**(Chorus)**  
C, C, that's the code I trust,  
From header files down to the pointer’s thrust,  
We’re breakin’ down code, no need for the fuss,  
C script flexin', come along, join us.

There it is! A rap entirely about C programming. C’s the boss, and we just let the code flow!
