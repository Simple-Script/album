(Verse 1)  
int main() the virus get in,  
Return 0 at the end, if-else statments risen,  
printf loops, watch the output spin,  
Memory breaks, letting leaks from within
malloc to allocate, stack is the key,  
free() scramble all the memory 
Arrays in the states, zero-index starts,  
Strings on array, to boot it on start.


(Verse 2)
From structs to enums, we define the ram,  
Preprocessor macros running start with lamb,  
File I/O, read and write with pace,  
Visibility tight, we donâ€™t leave a trace.
