Everybody listen up, this a young lesson
Go and get a fire carding site, go to the dump section
Never get a savings account dump, you always wanna cheque it
Make sure you go and grab a credit dump, they never hit with debit
You better put a proxy server on or use public connection
You can't get too comfortable on there, get the proper protection
When you're surfing on the dark web, you might get an infection
I can put a virus on computers without detection
Now you need some cloned cards, not them white blanks
Why would you go and use that anyway? It don't say a bank
I like to use my old debit card, the one I got from Chase
So when you go and pull the card out, it got the proper face
Okay, you gon' need the proper software
No dumb ass, you don't need EMV Software
That's only if you tryna code the chip they put on there
You just need an MSR, plus the Dev2 software
Once you got the items on that list, you can start here
Load up the software you just got, make sure the card near
You might have to scratch the numbers off to match the card year
The clerk really not gone say shit if you show no fear
Swipe the card through the MSR, erase the info
Then plug in Track 1 and Track 2 and write the info
Now it's time for you to slide straight to the store, see what it hit for
It's gon' look and work like a real card, no need to tip toe
This is a credit dump, so you can only use the mag strip
The clerk gon' let you swipe the card, after you jam the chip
After it ain't working two times, she'll let you use the strip
If your piece keeps saying declined, then that's your sign for you to dip
